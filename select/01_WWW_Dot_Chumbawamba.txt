With a W, and a W, and a W dot
With a W, and a W, and a W dot
With a W, and a W, and a W dot
Oh, Mr. Murdoch, can I show you around?
A new religion - no beat, no rhythm
Just Wal-Mart wall to wall
A Kodak baby in the land of plenty
Honey, I blew up the world
With a W, and a W, and a W dot
With a W, and a W, and a W dot
With a W, and a W, and a W dot
